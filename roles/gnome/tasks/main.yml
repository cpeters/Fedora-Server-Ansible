# Better fonts for Fedora
# fontconfig-font-replacements provides free substitutions for popular proprietary fonts from Microsoft and Apple operating systems.
#
# It makes your web browsing more aesthetically pleasing - you won't be seeing DejaVu Sans font on every damn webpage.
#
# Subpixel (rgb) antialiasing
# Default for Fedora are slight hinting and grayscale antialiasing.
# Some people find subpixel antialiasing to look better - others can't stand color fringing caused by it.
# If you want to try it for yourself install fontconfig-enhanced-defaults package.
# You can also enable it manually in Gnome Tweaks or by running following command in terminal:
